# 👋 Hey, I’m Sorin  

I like building things, sometimes quick prototypes, sometimes polished products that make their way to millions of people.  

Over the past 5+ years, I’ve worked at **Apple** and **Google**, turning ideas into shipped features, from bringing emojis to the Gmail iOS client to designing and optimizing ML pipelines.
